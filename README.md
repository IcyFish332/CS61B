# CS61B

There are all assignments and projects that I had done in CS61B Spring 2021 course.

CS61B is one of the most famous courses in UC Berkeley which is focused on data structures. The best project is called "gitlet"(Project2) asking students to implement most features of Git. I completed this by myself and wrote the design document.

The whole course is about 3000 lines of code in total.
